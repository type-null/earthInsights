# Earth insights

## description
Jog down and accumulate projects and experiences for resume (for now, and maybe cover letter). Chinese ver see [file](chinese.md).

Also save some resources related to the experiences as references for potential interview questions.

### some rules:
- highlight skills using backtick (\`), e.g., `AWS Glue`.
- do **not** delete any trunk of the material. Refine it, note it, keep it.
- typology:
  - professional experiences: intern and work
  - projects: course-related works 
  - activities: extracurricular works like volunteering and school society
- reverse chronological order within each category
- format: (use `---` as divider between events)
  > ACTIVITY NAME/JOB NAME, Company, Place
  
  > yyyy-mm-dd - yyyy-mm-dd
  
  > - Active verb with `skill` used.
  > - Bullet points.
