AUTOMATED AI PIPELINE ON AWS, Columbia University

2020-01-20 - Present

- Built a pre-processing `Python` library which unpacks and cleans JSON input and transforms the text into padded features.
- the model performs an inference. And passes the inference to the post processing. Deploy on Glue using `Spark SQL`.
- Automated by Lambda.
- Post Processing resolves the model output to the API output. And passes the input and output to the logging system and the front end.
- Logging system publishes a log entry. The frontend adds the appropriate response code. And respond to the call.
