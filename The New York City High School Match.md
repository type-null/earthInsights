# The New York City High School Match


## History

### NYC: largest public school system

### 1969: decentralized 30+ community school districts

### 1990: more centralized

### 2002: NYCDOE

- National Resident Matching Program for American physicians

### 2003: new strategy (this paper)

## I. The Prior (2002-2003) NYC Matching Procedure

### 7 specialized hs: entrance exam

- List 5

### Process applicants by program type

- Unscreened programs: lottery

	- Zoned Schools: prior local

	- One impetus: disadvantaged neighbor students not assigned to disadvantaged school

- Screened programs: individually

	- EdOpt programs:

		- Half: ELA

			- 16% top, 68% mid, 16% low

		- The other half: lottery

			- Same percent

		- Special rule: top 2% -> 1 rank on list

### 3 rounds of processing

- Congestion: not enough offers and acceptances to clear the market

### 3 motivations to change

- 1. 30,000 students not assigned to school they chose

- 2. Students had to be strategic

	- Risk of listing true first-choice school first

- 3. Schools also strategic

	- Conceal capacity from central admin, preserve places for later filling

## II. Design of New System

### Initial discuss

- Medical match

	- Two-sided

	- Stable assignment

- Clearinghouse

	- One-sided

		- Are the student the only real players?
